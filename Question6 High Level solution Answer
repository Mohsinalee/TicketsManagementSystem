a. Distributing Tickets to Multiple Assignees:

One approach to distribute the tickets to multiple assignees is to evenly divide the tickets among the assignees.
i) When assigning tickets, calculate the total number of tickets and the number of assignees.
ii) Divide the total number of tickets by the number of assignees to determine the approximate number of tickets
    each assignee will handle.
iii) Assign the calculated number of tickets to each assignee, ensuring that the distribution is as even as possible.


b. Auditing Ticket Updates and Viewing History:

To audit ticket updates and view their history, you can create an Audit entity and associate it with the Ticket entity.
i) Create an Audit entity with fields such as id, ticket_id, update_time, updated_by, old_status, new_status, etc.
ii) Add a @OneToMany relationship from the Ticket entity to the Audit entity to represent the audit history for each ticket.
iii) Whenever a ticket status is updated, create a new Audit record capturing the relevant information.
iv)  Provide an API endpoint to retrieve the audit history for a specific ticket.

c. Measuring Time Ticket Spent in Each Stage:

To measure the time a ticket spends in each stage, you can use timestamp fields and calculate the time differences.
i) Add timestamp fields for each stage in the Ticket entity, such as created_at, confirmed_at, technical_feedback_at, etc.
ii) When a ticket transitions to a new stage, update the corresponding timestamp field with the current time.
iii) Calculate the time spent in each stage by subtracting the entry timestamp from the exit timestamp for that stage.
iv) Provide an API endpoint to retrieve the time spent in each stage for a specific ticket.
